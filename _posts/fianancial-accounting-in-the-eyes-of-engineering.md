# Financial Accounting in the Eyes of an Software Engineer

As a deep into bone software engineer, learning one language a year has always been my goal to get fresh mind and postpone alzimers. 
Even through this goal has not been achieved each year. 

Last xmas, I decided to take my journey on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), 
a language developed at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/) targeted as a system language to build reliable and efficient software.

In order to practice my understanding on Rust, I took a coursera course [Financial Accounting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-accounting), and write a small application to do [Plain Text Accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/). 

The purpose of learning Rust and Financial Accounting at the same time with writing an application is aiming to reinforce my understanding. I found my neural interwived as a silkworm cocoon.
